     * Returns which has a higher range: a given linked list or a given tree.
     * The range of a data structure is the difference between its highest
     * value and its lowest value.
     * 
     * Returns "list" if the list has a higher range and "tree" if the tree has
     * a higher range. You can assume there will not be a tie, and neither head
     * nor root will be null.
     * 
     * Example:
     *   List:
     *      7 -> 8 -> -2 -> 9 -> 21
     *   Tree:
     *            12
     *          /    \
     *         6      18
     *        / \    /  
     *       4   8  16  
     *   Expected Answer: "list"
     * 
     * Explanation:
     *   The largest number in the list is 21 and -2 is the smallest.
     *   Thus the range of the list is 21 - -2 = 23
     *   The largest number in the tree is 18, and 4 is the smallest.
     *   Thus the range of the tree is 18 - 4 = 14
     *   23 is bigger than 14, so the list has the bigger range.
     *    
     * 
     * @param head the head of the list
     * @param root the root of the tree
     * @return "list" if the list has a bigger range, "tree" otherwise
